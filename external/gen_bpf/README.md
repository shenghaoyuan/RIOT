## original rBPF binary (fletcher32_bpf.bin.h)

This file is generated by `llvm + gen_rbpf`, which is used for the original rBPF interpreter.

## CertrBPF-interpreter binary (fletcher32_bpf.h)

Thie file is based on `fletcher32_bpf.bin.h`, but it modifies all `lddw` instructions (opcode = 0x18) : split two 64-bits instructions into `lddw-lo` (opcode = 0x18) and `lddw-hi` (opcode = 0x10), where we must modify the second 64-bits: opcode + dst + src

## CertrBPF-JIT binary (...)
